# photoalbum
photoalbum is a simple node/express app to let a user browse hierarchically organized sets of photos. Currently it's in a useable state but it's display only, you have to load the photos to the server manually.

It doesn't use much on the client except jquery and swipebox. It's responsive. Basically I wanted to learn a little CSS3 and used this project to do so.

Here's a sample site:
