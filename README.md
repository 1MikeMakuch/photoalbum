# photoalbum
photoalbum is a simple node/express app to let a user browse hierarchically organized sets of photos. Currently it's in a useable state but it's display only, you have to load the photos to the server manually.

It doesn't use much on the client except a little jquery and a module called swipebox for the full screen photo swiping on mobile. It's responsive. 

Here's a sample site:
